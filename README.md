# About the Project: Calculator
I created this calculator using Python, incorporating functions for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The user interface provides a seamless experience with input validation, and it includes a visually appealing ASCII art logo. After each calculation, the program offers the option to continue with the result or start a new calculation. The credits acknowledge the creator, adding a personal touch to the overall user experience.
